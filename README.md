# weave-workflow

This is a fork from the IFU workflow to also allow configuration of the MOS fields.

The IFU workflow is the ifu git submodule where I've limited the changes.

The MOS workflow is inside the mos directory, this heavily leans on the IFU workflow. 

It would be better to have a more integrated approach, but this was done to limit the changes to ifu so I can try to keep up with upstream changes.
