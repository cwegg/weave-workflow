          It is WEAVE policy to "lock" the arms: i.e. the red and blue
          arms must be observed with the same exposures within an OB.
          WEAVE science teams are permitted a limited subset of the
          below exposure options. PI surveys may use other combinations
          at their own risk.

            PROGTEMP = "23331":
              MOS, HR-Blue, R: 6x20min, B: 6x20min, spectral binning: 1
            PROGTEMP = "32332":
              MOS, HR-Green, R: 5x18min, B: 5x18min, spectral binning: 2
          Some RB combinations might be restricted due to excessive
          readout overheads, e.g.:
            PROGTEMP = "23601":
              MOS, HR-Blue, R: 12x10min, B: 1x120min
          The red arm here would incur a significant overhead readout
          penalty, and would not be completed at around the same time as
          the blue arm.
          NB: The "exp_time" column is for illustrative purposes and
          includes overheads in the total OB execution time: actual time
          on-target will be less.

        Some surveys would like to duplicate observing blocks.
        X(+) = Clone this XML Observing Block (X) times                 [NORBI.X]
        ===============================================                        ^
        This component is entirely optional: XMLChecking will not fail
        if there is no X value in the PROGTEMP.
        If a survey wishes to clone this OB, then they can add the .X
        directive onto the end of the PROGTEMP code.
        Furthermore, if users want to "chain" these OBs together, such
        that the observation of one of these clones increases the chance
        that the remaining OBs in this group are observed, then a "+"
        can be added to the end of PROGTEMP.
        The "+" instructs the WEAVE Scheduler to increase the (internal,
        survey-specific) weight of all OBs in this group. This provides
        a mechanism to ensure that once a series of observations are
        started, completion of the chain becomes a progressively higher
        priority above other OBs from this survey.
        Some examples:
          PROGTEMP = "11331.4":
            Create 4 OBs with the fibre configuraion as defined in this
            XML file.
          PROGTEMP = "11331.4+":
            As above, but probabilistically link them to ensure the
            chain is completed.

        their numerical values as defined within the WEAVE data model.
        For example:
          OBSTEMP = "AAAAA"
            S = "A" -> seeing_max="0.7"
            T = "A" -> transparency_min="0.8"

            M = "A" -> moondist_min="90"
            B = "A" -> skybright_max="21.7"

        The strategy for dithering within an OB is defined in the
        "apply_dither" attribute of the <dithering> element.
        Dithering is only supported for the WEAVE IFU modes.
        "apply_dither" attribute can take the following values:
          apply_dither  Meaning
          -1            Custom dither pattern (LIFU only)
           0            No dithering (this value is mandatory for MOS)
           3            Use pre-defined 3-dither pattern
          -3            Use alternate pre-defined 3-dither pattern
           4            Use pre-defined 4-dither pattern
           5            Use pre-defined 5-dither pattern
           6            Use pre-defined 6-dither pattern
        The pre-defined dither patterns can be found in the fibre
        configuration config file within the WEAVE data model.
        Please be aware that use of these pre-defined patterns may
        result in holes in the reconstructed cubelets for mIFU data
        (e.g. the 3-dither pattern). Please consult ICD-030 for more
        details.
        The <offsets> element will be populated by configure, using the
        data entered into the <fields> element.
