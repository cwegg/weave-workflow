Creation of MOS XMLs is much simpler than IFU XMLs.
We shadow the IFU creation for simplicity for the first 4 stages,
but at this point are finished.

Stage 1: Creation of field center fits file
-----------------------------------------

The target level catalogues submitted to the wasp don't know
anything about field centers. We first create a fits file
specifying where we'd like to construct OBs and with what
instrument settings/observation conditions.


Stage 2: Creation of the XML files from the field centers
---------------------------------------------------

We then create the XMLs from the field center catalogues. These XMLs don't yet
contain any targets.

Stage 3: Adding targets to the XML files
---------------------------------------------------

We then add the targets to the XMLs. These will be mostly science targets but
there may also be sky targets. The targets from every survey specified
in stage 1 should be added from their respective catalogues.


Stage 4: Adding guide and calibration stars to the XML files
------------------------------------------------------------

Each XML file is further developed by injecting the non-science target
information. This includes addition of the guidestar(s)
as well as calibration target options.

Stage 5: Configuring the XML files
----------------------------------

End-users are required to have a copy of Configure tools installed and
running for this stage. XML files are passed to the Configure
tools.
