Creation of MOS XMLs is much simpler than IFU XMLs.
We shadow the IFU creation for simplicity for the first 4 stages,
but at this point are finished.

Stage 1: Creation of field center catalogue
-----------------------------------------

The target level catalogues submitted to the wasp don't know
anything about field centers. We first create a fits file
specifying where we'd like to construct OBs and with what
instrument settings/observation conditions.


Stage 2: Creation of the XML files with the targets
---------------------------------------------------

We then create the XMLs with the targets from the catalogues to these.

Stage 3: Adding guide and calibration stars to the XML files
------------------------------------------------------------

Each XML file is further developed by injecting the non-science target
information. This includes addition of the guidestar(s)
as well as calibration target options.

Stage 4: Configuring the XML files
----------------------------------

End-users are required to have a copy of Configure tools installed and
running for this stage. XML files are passed to the Configure
tools. For LIFU observations, this serves solely to populate the XML
with the LIFU array, including correct positions for the fibres. For
the mIFU, this involves a more interactive method of dropping mIFU
bundles onto input targets. The location of the sky mIFU bundles is
chosen at this stage. Configure then calculates the bundle rotation
and consequently fibre positions. For the mIFU, this can be an
iterative process, whereby un-allocated targets may be re-submitted
to Configure in order to generate a new XML file (and hence
observation) with these additional targets. For both IFU modes, where
required Configure will implement the pre-set dither pattern. This is
controlled by the apply_dither' attribute in the <dithering> element,
which in turn is inherited from the ifu_dither column in stage 0
catalogue.
